The goal of the project is to study Test Driven Development and implement an algorithm with JAVA under this method.

1. Write test and run it to see it fail
2. Implement the algorythm in the smallest and smartest way to pass the test in GREEN
3. Refactor if needed
> All part of this project was write with the [*Programming Wishfull Thinking*](https://wiki.c2.com/?WishfulThinking) method.
